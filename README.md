# hello-world
Taking the tutorial -- step by step
Changed via Eclipse and Github Desktop:
Used Clone, and then in Eclipse New Project, disable "Use default location", and browse to the Github folder containg this file.

Committed these changes, then (what used to be "Synchronize" 
in the old Github desktop), "Push" and "Fetched".
A recoverable interim was created as a new local branch. 

Now editing a lot which I originally wanted to publish yet but...
first I have to try a variant (these lines after 13) which I may
need to remove again

The above should be recoverable despite not yet committed to 
master, but this not this. How to do that -- and quickly because 
that's the stage where I am most confused, with two levels of 
change pending!


By toggling in the Github desktop, it was also toggled in Eclipse 
(visible only after clicking ''somewhere'' in Eclipse!).
